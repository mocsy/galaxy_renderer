   a 2D Galaxy Renderer based on the density wave theory
   (C) 2012 Ingo Berg

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Project provides source code to render a 2D Galaxy with the SDL/OpenGL. The code
will compile into a small application allowing you to create 2D galaxies by modifying
a set of geometrical parameters. There is only a minimalistic user interface 
as main purpose of the code was to render animations for the wikipedia article on dark 
matter:

  The renderer is in part based on code written by John Walker (specrend.c).
